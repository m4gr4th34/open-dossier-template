verify_numbers.py — Open Dossier survey-consistency verifier (template stub).

This is the Python mirror of the consistency console in index.html. A survey's
verification weight sits mostly in the citation audit (dossier.html); this
script runs the same cross-avenue CONSISTENCY checks the browser console runs,
so CI and the live page always agree.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:
Keep the AVENUES list below in lockstep with the AVENUES array in index.html
(same name / status / forecast / signpost shape), then add your survey's real
cross-avenue and arithmetic checks alongside the built-in consistency checks.

The contract (unchanged):
  - computed value must fall within [claimed_lo, claimed_hi]
  - if it doesn't, this script exits nonzero — CI goes red — fix the PAPER
  - never widen the tolerance to make a failing check pass
  - label is the exact check as it reads on the page

Run locally:  python verification/verify_numbers.py
CI runs this: on every push (see .github/workflows/verify.yml)
