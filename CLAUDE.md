# CLAUDE.md — Working doctrine for this repository

This repo is an Open Dossier: a living research publication. These rules
are non-negotiable and apply to every session.

## Before any commit
- Run `python verification/verify_numbers.py`. If any check fails,
  fix the manuscript or the model — NEVER widen a tolerance to pass.
- If a change alters any number in the paper, the corresponding check
  in verify_numbers.py AND the JS port in index.html must be updated
  to match. All three must agree.

## Verification labels are sacred
- Every claim's status in claim_ledger.csv must be true. Claims nobody
  verified are labeled OPEN-UNVERIFIED, never asserted.
- Manuscript language must match ledger status: unverified claims say
  "is expected to" or "we conjecture", never "yields" or "is".

## Releases vs commits
- Plain commits: site edits, typo fixes, doc improvements. Push freely.
- Releases (git tags): substantive milestones only. A release triggers
  automatic Zenodo DOI archiving and OpenTimestamps blockchain anchoring.
  Do not create releases without the author's explicit instruction.
- NEVER modify anything in timestamps/ — those are cryptographic proofs.

## File map
- index.html        — interactive edition (sliders + verification console)
- paper.html        — self-explaining edition (term/citation expansions)
- dossier.html      — audit trail (red team, citation audit)
- paper/            — LaTeX manuscript + PDF
- verification/     — verify script, audits, red-team report, format spec
- claim_ledger.csv  — every claim, typed, with honest status

## Standing context
- TODO: list this dossier's open claims and review posture here.
